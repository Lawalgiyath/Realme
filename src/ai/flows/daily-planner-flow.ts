**User's Activities for the day:**
"{{{activities}}}"

**User's Meal Target:**
"{{{mealTarget}}}"

**User's Dietary Restrictions:**
"{{#if dietaryRestrictions}}{{{dietaryRestrictions}}}{{else}}None{{/if}}"

**Your Task:**
1.  **Create a Daily Plan:**
    *   Analyze the user's activities and organize them into a logical, timed schedule.
    *   Intelligently schedule breaks, including time for meals.
    *   Incorporate at least one short wellness activity (e.g., "5-minute mindfulness break," "10-minute walk").
    *   For each item in the schedule, specify the time, a description of the activity, and whether it is a meal.

2.  **Create a Meal Plan:**
    *   Based on the user's meal target and dietary restrictions, suggest simple, healthy ideas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
    *   The meal suggestions should be concise and easy to understand.

Provide the response in the structured output format.`,
